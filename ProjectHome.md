# Overview #

The [Android operating system](http://developer.android.com/index.html) provides an opportunity for educators and students to experience development for mobile devices using free and open source tools. The Android4CS2 project brings the typical content of a second-semester course in data structures (stacks, queues, lists, trees, graphs) to a relevant, visual, and interactive context for our students. Our work serves two purposes:

  * Help CS2 students better understand the central role of basic data structures within modular programming.
  * Provide an environment for students to learn mobile development and industry frameworks within the familiar setting of small projects.

This work builds on projects from [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](http://legacy.lclark.edu/~drake/dsaj.html) by [Peter Drake](http://legacy.lclark.edu/~drake/Home.html) (2005).  Dr. Mark Goadrich and Dr. Matthew Jadud are implementing this project in the classroom at [Centenary College](http://centenary.edu/math/csc) in Shreveport, LA and [Allegheny College](http://rockalypse.org/courses/cmpsc112sp11/) in Meadville, PA in Spring 2011.
